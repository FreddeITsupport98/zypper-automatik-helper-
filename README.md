# Zypper Auto-Downloader for Tumbleweed

![openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://img.shields.io/badge/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-73ba25?style=for-the-badge&logo=opensuse)

A robust `systemd` architecture that automates `zypper dup` downloads, provides persistent, battery-safe **user notifications**, and cleanly upgrades any previous version.

-----

## 🎯 The Goal

On a rolling-release distribution like Tumbleweed, updates are frequent and can be large. This script automates the most time-consuming part: the **download**.

It runs `zypper dup --download-only` in the background, but only when it's safe. When you're ready to update, the packages are already cached. This turns a potential 10-minute download and update process into a 1-minute, authenticated installation.

## ✨ Key Features (v41.1 Architecture)

* **Decoupled Architecture:** Two separate services: a "safe" root-level downloader and a "smart" **user-level** notifier.
* **User-Space Notifier:** The notifier now runs as a user service (`~/.config/systemd/user`), ensuring it has proper access to the desktop environment (D-Bus) for reliable, clickable notifications.
* **Safe Downloads:** The root downloader service will **only** run when you are on **AC Power** and **not** on a **Metered Connection**.
* **Persistent Reminders:** The user notifier service runs every hour and will *always* remind you if updates are pending, even on battery.
* **Hybrid Logic:** The notifier script is smart:
    * If you're on battery/metered, it **skips `zypper refresh`** (saving power/data) and checks the local cache.
    * If you're on AC power, it runs a full `zypper refresh` to get the latest info before checking.
* **Clickable Install:** The rich, Python-based desktop notification is **clickable**. Clicking the "Install" button immediately launches a terminal, prompts for your password via `pkexec`, and starts the `zypper dup`.
* **Automatic Upgrader:** The installer script is idempotent and will **cleanly stop, disable, and overwrite any previous version** (v1-v40) to ensure a clean migration.
* **Dependency Checks:** The installer verifies all necessary dependencies (`nmcli`, `upower`, `python3-gobject`) are present and offers to install them if they are missing.

## 🛠️ How It Works: The v41.1 Architecture

This is a two-service system to provide both safety (Downloader) and persistence/user interaction (Notifier).

### 1. The Installer: `zypper-auto.sh`

* **Cleanup:** Explicitly stops and disables all timers/services from *any* previous version to ensure a clean state.
* **User Detection:** Reliably determines the `$SUDO_USER`'s home directory to place the user-specific systemd files and scripts (`~/.config/systemd/user`, `~/.local/bin`).

### 2. The Downloader (Root Service)

This service's only job is to download packages when it's safe.

* **Service:** `/etc/systemd/system/zypper-autodownload.service`
    * This service runs `zypper refresh` and `zypper dup --download-only`.
    * It will **only** start if `ConditionACPower=true` and `ConditionNotOnMeteredConnection=true` are met.
* **Timer:** `/etc/systemd/system/zypper-autodownload.timer`
    * Runs `OnBootSec=1min` and `OnUnitActiveSec=1h`, attempting to trigger the service every hour.

### 3. The Notifier (User Service)

This service's job is to check for updates and remind you, running as your standard user.

* **Service:** `~/.config/systemd/user/zypper-notify-user.service`
    * Runs the Python script `~/.local/bin/zypper-notify-updater.py`.
    * Because it runs in user-space, it has the correct D-Bus environment variables to display notifications reliably.
* **Timer:** `~/.config/systemd/user/zypper-notify-user.timer`
    * Runs on a 5-minute offset (e.g., `OnBootSec=5min`) to ensure it runs *after* the downloader has had a chance.

### 4. The "Brains": `~/.local/bin/zypper-notify-updater.py`

This Python script is the core of the system, run by the `zypper-notify-user.service` every hour.

1.  **Checks Safety:** Uses `upower` and `nmcli` to determine if a refresh is safe (Hybrid Logic).
2.  **Runs Zypper:** Executes `pkexec zypper refresh` (if safe) and `pkexec zypper dup --dry-run` to check for pending updates.
3.  **Parses Output:** Counts packages, finds the latest Tumbleweed Snapshot version.
4.  **Sends Clickable Notification:** Uses PyGObject to send a rich notification with the Snapshot version and an **"Install"** button.
5.  **Launches Terminal (Action):** Clicking "Install" runs the `~/.local/bin/zypper-run-install` script, which launches your preferred terminal (`konsole`, `gnome-terminal`, etc.) to execute `pkexec zypper dup` interactively.

-----

## 🚀 Installation / Upgrading

The script is idempotent. You can run this on a fresh install *or* on a PC with an older version.

1.  Download the latest `zypper-auto.sh` script.
2.  Make it executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x zypper-auto.sh
    ```
3.  Run it with `sudo`. The script will handle all cleanup, dependency checks, and the installation of the root service.
    ```bash
    sudo ./zypper-auto.sh
    ```
4.  **Crucial Final Step:** The installer cannot enable user-level services. You must run this command **as your regular user** (do not use `sudo`) to enable the notifier timer:
    ```bash
    systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user enable --now zypper-notify-user.timer
    ```

You're done! The root downloader is enabled, and the user notifier is ready.

## 🏃 Usage

1.  **Wait.** The services run in the background. The downloader attempts to run hourly when conditions are safe.
2.  **Get Notified.** You will get a notification *only* when new updates are pending.
    > **Snapshot 20251110-0 Ready**
    > 12 updates are pending. Click 'Install' to begin.
3.  **Install.** Click the **"Install"** button in the notification. This will open a terminal and prompt you for authentication to run `zypper dup`.

### Verifying the Services

```bash
# 1. Check Root Timer (Downloader)
# Should show "active" and the next scheduled run time
systemctl list-timers zypper-autodownload.timer

# 2. Check User Timer (Notifier)
# Must be run as your regular user. Should show "active" and the next scheduled run time.
systemctl --user list-timers zypper-notify-user.timer

# 3. Check the status of the last DOWNLOADER run
systemctl status zypper-autodownload.service

# 4. View the detailed logs from the smart notification script
journalctl --user -u zypper-notify-user.service

# Edit the root downloader's schedule:
sudoedit /etc/systemd/system/zypper-autodownload.timer

# Edit the user notifier's schedule:
systemctl --user edit --full zypper-notify-user.timer

# For the root downloader:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart zypper-autodownload.timer

# For the user notifier (as your regular user):
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart zypper-notify-user.timer

# 1. Stop and disable the root timer
sudo systemctl disable --now zypper-autodownload.timer

# 2. Stop and disable the user timer (run as regular user)
systemctl --user disable --now zypper-notify-user.timer

# 3. Remove all systemd files and scripts
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/zypper-autodownload.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/zypper-autodownload.timer

# Replace $HOME with your actual home directory (or run as regular user)
rm -f $HOME/.config/systemd/user/zypper-notify-user.service
rm -f $HOME/.config/systemd/user/zypper-notify-user.timer
rm -f $HOME/.local/bin/zypper-notify-updater.py
rm -f $HOME/.local/bin/zypper-run-install

# 4. Reload the systemd daemons
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl --user daemon-reload
